            <div class="text">Like humans, chimps are highly adaptable, and have been observed in diverse habitats such as dry savanna, evergreen, montane and swamp forests, and dry woodland-savanna. Forest chimps spend most of the day in the treetop canopies feeding and searching for food.</div>
            <img src="images/monkey.png" alt="chimp icon">
            <div class="text">Wild chimpanzees live in “communities” of between twenty and 150 individuals, organised in complicated social hierarchies. Grooming rituals, used to remove ticks and maintain cleanliness, help to strengthen social bonds between group members. Half of individuals remain with their community for life, while the female half tend to migrate between groups.</div>
            <img src="images/animal.png" alt="chimp face icon">
            <div class="text">Chimpanzees are covered in coarse hair, which is typically black but can be ginger or brown. Their human-like faces are bare, as are their fingers, toes, palms and soles. Chimps also lose hair as they age, leading to bald sports across the body.</div>

        <div class="quotes">The endangered chimpanzee, one of five species of great ape, inhabits the tropical savannas and forests of central and west Africa. It is threatened by the activities of another great ape, one of its closest relatives in the animal kingdom, with whom it shares 98.7% of its DNA - humans.</div>
